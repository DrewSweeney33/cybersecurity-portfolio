## üõ°Ô∏è Projects

This repository showcases a variety of projects I‚Äôve built‚Äîfrom infrastructure and automation to web development and systems administration‚Äîall developed with a strong focus on secure design and best practices. While not every project is centered around security, each one reflects my dedication to integrating security principles throughout the development lifecycle. Whether it's hardening a self-hosted web application, deploying services with least-privilege access, or automating secure configurations, these projects represent my commitment to building solutions that are not only functional, but resilient. This portfolio serves as a space to document my work, share progress, and continually refine my approach as both a developer and security practitioner.
