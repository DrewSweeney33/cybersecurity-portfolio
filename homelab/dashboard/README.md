## ðŸ§© Homarr Dashboard

This is my self-hosted Homarr dashboard, a centralized homepage that provides quick access to the core services running in my homelab environment. Built with usability and visibility in mind, this dashboard helps organize and monitor tools like Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Plex, and more. It's deployed via Docker and integrated with my reverse proxy setup using Traefik and NGINX, all running within a Proxmox LXC. The dashboard is accessible securely through a Cloudflare Tunnel, ensuring that even external access adheres to strong security practices. This project reflects both functional homelab organization and a commitment to secure, scalable self-hosting.
