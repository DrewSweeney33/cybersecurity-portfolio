## üè° Homelab Environment

This section documents my self-hosted homelab environment, where I deploy, configure, and secure various services to mirror enterprise infrastructure at home. Running on Proxmox with a combination of LXC containers and Docker, the lab is designed for continuous learning, testing, and refinement of real-world cybersecurity practices.

My homelab includes tools for media management, network monitoring, reverse proxying, dashboards, and VPN tunneling‚Äîall integrated through Traefik, NGINX, and secured with Cloudflare Tunnel. Emphasis is placed on secure access, automation, container orchestration, and segmented network design.

This environment serves both as a learning playground and a proving ground for DevSecOps concepts, secure architecture, and system administration.
