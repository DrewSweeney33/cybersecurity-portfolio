ðŸ§¾ CSEC 428 â€“ IT Risk Management

This course explores the processes, frameworks, and practical applications of IT risk management. I learned to distinguish between risk governance and risk management, assess threats in complex digital environments, and develop mitigation strategies. The course emphasized real-world assessments and prepared students for the ISACA IT Risk Fundamentals certification.
