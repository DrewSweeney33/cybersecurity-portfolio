ðŸ§ª Lab 02 â€“ Performing a Vulnerability Assessment

This lab introduced vulnerability scanning with tools like Zenmap, Nessus, Nmap, and OpenVAS. I scanned both application and infrastructure targets, analyzed services and potential weaknesses, and compiled a penetration test report with CVEs and remediation strategies. Key findings included SQL injection, insecure cipher suites, and misconfigurations, which I addressed with proper security headers, updated certificates, and stronger encryption standards.
