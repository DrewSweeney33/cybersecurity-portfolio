ðŸ§ª Lab 06 â€“ Assessing Common Attack Vectors

This lab simulated common cyber attacks including XSS, SQL injection, malware delivery, DDoS, and social engineering using tools like SET and Metasploit. After executing each attack, I analyzed their impact and documented defense strategies such as input validation, endpoint protection, rate limiting, MFA, and user awareness training. I also researched MitM attacks and proposed PKI and TLS encryption as effective defenses.
