ðŸ§ª Lab 10 â€“ Performing Incident Response and Forensic Analysis

This lab introduced incident response procedures and forensic analysis techniques. I examined packet captures and disk images to identify suspicious activity, exfiltrated files, and malware behavior. Using the evidence, I developed an incident report detailing affected systems, users, and attacker methods. The analysis reinforced key concepts in timeline reconstruction, root cause analysis, and digital evidence handling.
