ðŸ§ª Lab 09 â€“ Configuring Backup and Recovery Functions

This lab covered critical elements of disaster recovery planning. I configured Windows Server Backup, scheduled system state backups, and practiced restoring from backups. Additionally, I built out an NFS-based web server setup and implemented HAProxy load balancing with failover functionality to support high availability. Testing confirmed the setup could maintain uptime across multiple hosts.
