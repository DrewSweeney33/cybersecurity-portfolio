ðŸ§ª Lab 03 â€“ Performing Packet Capture and Traffic Analysis

Using Wireshark, this lab focused on capturing and analyzing various types of network traffic, including FTP, ICMP, HTTP, SSH, and WLAN traffic. I explored secure and unsecure transmissions, interpreted encryption handshakes, and inspected packet-level data. Additionally, I generated and reviewed malicious traffic using deauthentication attacks to understand wireless vulnerabilities and the importance of traffic inspection in detecting anomalies.
