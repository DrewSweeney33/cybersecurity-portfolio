ðŸ§ª Lab 08 â€“ Implementing Security Monitoring and Logging

In this lab, I implemented host and network-level logging and intrusion detection. I used Windows Event Viewer and rsyslog in Linux to detect failed login attempts, and configured Snort to actively monitor and alert on suspicious traffic. I also integrated Tripwire to validate file integrity changes. The challenge analysis included researching cryptographic operation failures (Event ID 5061) and configuring Snort as a basic intrusion prevention system.
