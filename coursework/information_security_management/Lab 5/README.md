ðŸ§ª Lab 05 â€“ Using Encryption to Enhance Confidentiality and Integrity

This lab explored both asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods using GPG and Kleopatra. I generated key pairs, exchanged certificates, encrypted/decrypted messages, and signed documents digitally. Additionally, I implemented hybrid encryption by securely transferring encrypted files and secret keys, reinforcing the importance of layered cryptographic practices in secure communication.
