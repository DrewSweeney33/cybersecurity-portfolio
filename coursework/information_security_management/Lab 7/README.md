ðŸ§ª Lab 07 â€“ Implementing an IT Security Policy

This lab focused on the implementation of organization-wide IT security policies, including password complexity, real-time protection settings, and mobile device security configurations. I applied Windows security baselines using Group Policy, enforced antivirus controls, and configured encryption, update policies, and remote management on Android devices. The analysis involved reviewing real-world acceptable use and privacy policies, highlighting key practices such as monitoring, legal compliance, and data protection.
