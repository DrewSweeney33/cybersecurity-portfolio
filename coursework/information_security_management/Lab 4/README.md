ðŸ§ª Lab 04 â€“ Applying User Authentication and Access Controls

In this lab, I configured users, groups, shared folders, and access control permissions in both Windows Active Directory and TrueNAS. I tested permission enforcement, documented access failures and successes, and verified security inheritance. This hands-on experience reinforced the principles of least privilege, role-based access control (RBAC), and centralized identity management in real-world systems.
