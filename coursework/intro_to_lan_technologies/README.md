ðŸ§¾ NET 413 â€“ Introduction to LAN Technologies

This course introduced foundational concepts in local area networking including switching, routing, VLANs, IPv4/IPv6, and wireless networking. Through Cisco Networking Academy labs and CLI practice, I built and configured small networks, troubleshooted routing issues, and developed skills in subnetting, static routes, and LAN security.
