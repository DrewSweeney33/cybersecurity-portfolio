ðŸ§¾ CSEC 378/418 â€“ Host-Based Security

This course focused on securing individual host systems, covering critical topics such as OS configuration, access control, host-based firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention, and compliance auditing. With a hands-on approach, I worked extensively with both Linux and Windows environments, performing secure configurations and scripting in both Bash and PowerShell. The course emphasized applying practical security techniques to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of host systems in real-world scenarios.
