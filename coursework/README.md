## ðŸ“š Master's Program â€“ Cybersecurity @ DePaul University

This repository includes a curated collection of work completed as part of my Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity at DePaul University. The program is designed to bridge theoretical foundations with practical, hands-on learning in information security. My focus has been on developing a deep understanding of how to secure complex systems, assess and mitigate risk, and defend modern infrastructures against evolving threats. Through labs, research, and projects, Iâ€™ve explored topics like secure network architecture, identity and access management, vulnerability analysis, incident response, and cloud-native security practices. This space serves as a living portfolio to showcase the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve developed throughout the program, as well as a platform to document my continued learning in the field.
