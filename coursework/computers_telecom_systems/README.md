ðŸ§¾ NET 411 â€“ Introduction to Computer and Telecom Systems

This course served as an entry point into the foundational concepts of computer systems, networking, and telecommunications. Topics included systems architecture, network protocols, virtualization, and network security. Through hands-on labs using Linux, Cisco IOS, and shell scripting, I gained practical experience in configuring and managing basic network environments. The course culminated in a final paper and presentation on a selected systems topic, reinforcing research and communication skills alongside technical knowledge.
